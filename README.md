## What I wanted to do:
### Build a CSV importer to SQLite in python using an object relational mapping solution (ORM). Use SQLAlchemy as my ORM.
__*Some specifications:*__
1. Solution shall be ORM based.
2. csv input file shall consist of data belonging to multiple tables.
3. input column header names shall identify database table and field names.
4. Solution shall "know" how to map between input columns and database table-fields
Why?
- An object relational mapping (ORM) solution simplifies reduces/eliminates SQL coding from my code
- Object oriented approach to SQL coding allows for more object oriented python code

## What I actually was able to do:

__*Repo Items:*__
- Readme.md: this file!
