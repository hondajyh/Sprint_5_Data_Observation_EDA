## SPRINT #5: Describing Data: Observations, Hypotheses, EDA
### 01/25/2018

**Author:** Jon Honda

## What I wanted to do:
### Develop a process for performing exploratory data analysis. I hope to use the process as a template during future data analysis.

## What I actually was able to do:
#### I developed an EDA proces: 
 1. Remember: 
    a. the goal is to develop a sense of "what is going on" by identifying patterns
    b. let the data drive your exploration.
 2. Analysis doesn't need to be completely perfect. But, you should identify knowledge gaps and errors e.g.:
    a. Is the data showing unreasonable results? (e.g. data set was stated to be between 2008 and 2015, but we see data from 2007).
    b. When analyzing the data, you will naturally develop hypotheses to explain the data. How will you disprove the hypotheses?
    c. What uncertainty do you have about the how the data was collected? e.g., is your twitter data set collected during a huricane skewed by internet connection availability?
 3. What summaries can you conclude from exploring the data? Use graphing and visual tools:
    a. Python plotting library (including maps) https://plot.ly/python/scattermapbox/#mapbox-access-token
    b. Seaborn is a library for making attractive and informative statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and tightly integrated with the PyData stack, including support for numpy and pandas data structures and statistical routines from scipy and statsmodels.
    c. Wordcloud: https://github.com/amueller/word_cloud A little word cloud generator in Python. Read more about it on the blog post or the website. The code is Python 2, but Python 3 compatible. 
 4. Develop a plan to address how you will test your summaries against the knowledge gaps you identified.
